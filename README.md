# deep-learning-challenge

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to assist Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization, in identifying funding applicants with the highest likelihood of success. The neural network model was designed to predict whether an applicant would effectively utilize the funding provided, based on a variety of features such as application type, organization affiliation, and funding amount requested. The project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation techniques to improve predictive accuracy.

Both the original and optimized versions of the notebook are available in the main branch of the repository, alongside the project write-up report stored as Neural-Network-Model.md. Additionally, the result files, saved in HDF5 format, are located in a folder named Models, which is also included in the main branch for easy access.

This project showcases the process of building, fine-tuning, and documenting a deep learning model for classification tasks, with a focus on reproducibility and data-driven insights.
