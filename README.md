# deep-learning-challenge

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model to assist 'Alphabet Soup', a fictional nonprofit organization, in identifying funding applicants with a high likelihood of success. The neural network model was designed to predict whether an applicant would utilize the funding successfully, based on a variety of features such as application type, organization affiliation, and funding amount requested. The project includes data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation techniques to improve predictive accuracy.

Both the original and optimized versions of the notebook are available in the main branch of the repository, alongside the project write-up report stored as Neural-Network-Model.md. Additionally, the result files, saved in HDF5 format, are located in a folder named Models, which is also included in the main branch for easy access.

This project showcases the process of building, fine-tuning, and documenting a deep learning model for classification tasks and is focused on producing repeatable, actionable insights.
